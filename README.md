simple script for options credit strategy

This script fetches the historical prices for a given stock symbol and calculates the moving average for a specified period.
It then checks whether the current price is above the moving average and sells an option credit if it is.
The script uses the Tastytrade API to authenticate with your account and place the order for the option credit.

Please note that this is just an example script and you should thoroughly test 
and backtest any trading strategy before using it in a live trading environment.
